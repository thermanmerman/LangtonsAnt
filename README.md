# LangtonsAnt

I got this idea from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1EgjgMo48U

I've recently become extremely interested in visualizations of mathematical phenomena and cellular automata and found a YouTube video on a fascinating cellular automata experiment called Langton's Ant. In this experiment, there is a grid with an ant in the middle of the cell; each cell is either black or white. If the ant is on a white square, it will flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees clockwise, and move forward one cell. If it is on a black square, it will flip the color, turn 90 degrees counterclockwise, and move forward one cell. The result is a wild pattern that continues to grow more complex the longer it runs. This experiment inspired me to create a program that executes/simulates that same process.
