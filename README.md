# LangtonsAnt

I got this idea from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1EgjgMo48U

I've recently gotten into visualizations of mathematical phenomena and cellular automata. My interests often manifest themselves in my YouTube recommendations, and this was one of those occurrences. The video I found was on a fascinating little cellular automata experiment called Langton's Ant. It has a wildly thorough Wikipedia page, but in case you don't want to read all of that, I'll give the summary here. Imagine a grid with an ant in the middle of the cell and each cell is either black or white (or alive or dead as I put it in the code). If the ant is on a white square, it will flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees clockwise, and move forward one cell. If it is on a black square, it will flip the color, turn 90 degrees counterclockwise, and move forward one cell. The result is a wild pattern that continues to grow more complex the longer it runs, and I think it is so cool.
